# TypeScript Data Structures and Algorithms Exercise

Intended as a personal learning exercise to help knock off some rust with Algorithms and Data Structures while solidifying my knowledge of TypeScript. Work in progress.

## Data Structures

**Worst-Case Time Complexity**
| Data Structure | Access | Search | Insert | Remove |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Singly Linked List | O(n) | O(n) | O(1)[^1] | O(1)[^2] |

[^1]: When the node prior to the target position is stored, or is the root node.
[^2]: When the node to be removed is stored, or is the root node.

**Expected-Case Time Complexity**
(for those data structures where it differs from the worst-case)
| Data Structure | Access | Search | Insert | Remove |
|---|---|---|---|---|
|   |   |   |   |   |

**Worst-Case Space Complexity**
(for data structures where it is a notable, distinguishing characteristic)
| Data Structure | Access | Search | Insert | Remove |
|---|---|---|---|---|
|   |   |   |   |   |
